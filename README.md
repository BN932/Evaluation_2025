This code is a PHP - MVC architecture project build for a school assessment.
The topic of this project is the blo of a developper, built around the RESTful routes INDEX, SHOW, NEW, EDIT & DELETE (with form for the NEW and EDIT routes). 
It was realized based on a HTML - CSS template supplied by the teacher, as well as a mock-up DB (MYSQL) to which the project is connected (DB is local, not online).
This project also integrates a pagination system, as well as the upload of pictures for the posts, and the logic layer necessary to handle the uploads (conditionals to organize picture handling for each routes).
